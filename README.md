# Election Analysis
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose
Tom, my client, is a Colorado Board of Elections employee and would like a completed election audit of a recent local congressional election. He desires to obtain the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes each candidate received, the percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. The election commission has further requested the following additional data to complete the audit: voter turnout for each county, percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. 
## Results
* How many votes were cast in this congressional election? 
  * To obtain the total number of votes cast in the election I initialized a variable named “total_votes”. I set “total_votes” equal to zero and placed it above the code where I opened the file. I did this ensure that each iteration of the for loop, which I wrote upon opening the file, maintained the zero-starting value. Within this stated for loop, I incremented the “total_votes” by one. I then printed the total votes of the election using f-string formatting and found that there were 369,711 total votes cast.

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct. 
  * To generate county results, I first needed to acquire the names of each county that participated in the election. To do this, I declared a new list “county_list=[]” to hold the names of the counties and added it before the “with open()” statement of the script. I then used indexing within the for loop to print the county’s name from each row. I set “county_name” equal to “row[1]” since the county column is the second column in the file. I then added “county_name” to the “county_list” using the append () method. I utilized an if statement with the not in membership operator to check if the county had been added to the list. If the county’s name had been added to the list, then the next time the county’s name was found in a row using the for loop, it would not be added again to the list. The output for the code gave me the following county names that participated in the election: Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe.

  * To obtain the number of votes, I created a dictionary where the key was the county name and the value for the key was the votes cast for each county. I declared an empty dictionary, “county_votes={}”, and placed it before the with open() statement. Inside the if statement, I began tracking the county’s vote count by setting “county_votes[county_name]” equal to zero. I then started tallying the votes for each county by incrementing “county_votes[county_name] by one for every time I ran the file. However, to ensure that each county’s vote count was incremented every time its name appeared in a row, I moved the “county_votes[county_name] +=1” inside the for loop and aligned with the if statement.

  * To calculate the percentage of votes for each county, I divided the county’s vote county by the total vote count and multiplied it by 100. I used the following formula: “votes_percentage= (votes / total_votes) *100”. The votes represent the values of each “county_name” in the “county_votes” dictionary. To obtain the percentage, I converted votes and total_votes to floating-point decimal numbers. I then initialized a variable “county_results” that would generate the county name, their vote percentage, and their total votes. I utilized f-string formatting and configured it to one decimal place. Upon printing “county_results”, I found that Arapahoe had the least votes.

* Which county had the largest number of votes? 
  * To determine which county had the largest number of votes, I declared a variable to hold an empty string value for the largest county. I declared a variable for the “largest_county_voter_turnout” and set it equal to zero. Then I created an if statement inside the for loop to determine if the vote count calculated was greater than the “largest_county_voter_turnout”. If the vote count was greater, I set “largest_county_voter_turnout” equal to votes. I then set “largest_county” equal to “county_name”. After this, I initialized a variable “summary” that would name the county with the largest number of votes. I then added a print statement after the if statement and aligned with the for loop (for county_name in county_votes) to print the “summary”. Upon printing this in the text file, I found that Denver had the largest county turnout.

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received. 
  * To generate candidate results, I first needed to acquire the names of each candidate that participated in the election. To do this, I declared a new list, “candidate_options=[]”, and added it before the “with open()” statement of the script. I then used indexing within the for loop to print the candidate’s name from each row. I set “candidate_name” equal to “row[2]” since the candidate column is the third column in the file. I then added the “candidate_name” to the “candidate_options” list using the append () method. Following this, I wrote a statement that would print out the “candidate_options” list.  Upon running this code, I acquired every candidate from each row. However, I only needed the unique candidate names. To get the unique names in the “candidate_options” list, I utilized an if statement with the not in membership operator to check if the candidate has been added to the list. If the candidate's name had been added to the list, then the next time the candidate's name was found in a row using the for loop, it would not be added to the list. The output of this code gave me the following candidates: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane.

  * To obtain the number of votes cast for each candidate, I created a dictionary where the key was each candidate’s name and the value for the key was the vote count for the candidate. I declared an empty dictionary “candidate_votes= {}” and placed it before the with open() statement. Inside the if statement, I began tracking the candidate’s voter count by setting “candidate_votes[candidate_name]” equal to zero. I then started tallying the votes for each candidate by incrementing “candidate_votes[candidate_name]” by one for every time I ran the file. However, to ensure that each candidate’s vote count was incremented every time their name appeared in a row, I moved the “candidate_votes[candidate_name] +=1” inside the for loop and aligned with the if statement.

  * To calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate, I divided the candidate’s vote count by the total vote count and multiplied it by 100. I used the following formula: “vote_percentage= (votes / total_votes) *100”. The votes represent the values of each “candidate_name” in the “candidate_votes” dictionary. To get the percentage, I converted votes and total_votes to floating-point decimal numbers. I then initialized a variable “candidate_results” that would generate the candidate’s name, their percentage of votes, and their total votes. I utilized f-string formatting and configured it to one decimal place. Upon printing “candidate_results”, I found that Diana DeGette received the highest percentage of the votes.

* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
  * To determine which candidate won the election, I declared a variable to hold an empty string value for the winning candidate. I declared a variable for the “winning_count” and set it equal to zero. I also declared a variable for the “winning_percentage” and set it equal to zero. I placed all of these variables before the with open() statement. Then I created an if statement inside the for loop to determine if the vote count that was calculated was greater than the “winning_count”. If the vote count is greater than the “winning_count” and the percentage is greater than the “winning_percentage”, then I set the “winning_count” equal to votes and the “winning_percentage” equal to vote percentage. I set the “winning_count” equal to “candidate_name”. I then initialized a variable “winning_candidate_summary” that would name the winning candidate, their vote count, and their percentage of votes. I then added a print statement after the if statement and aligned with the for loop (for candidate in candidate_votes) to print the “winning_candidate_summary”. Upon running the code, I found that Diane DeGette was the winner of the election with 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

## Summary
### Recommendations
This current script is useful as it automates the congressional election audit process. Its utility proves that it can work, with some modifications, for any given election. If a client were interested in running an election audit for senatorial districts, the script would need to be modified since there are 100 US senators, two elected from each state, in a senatorial election. This effectively means that in place of the county list and county votes dictionary, I would create a state list and state votes dictionary. Additionally, as senatorial races are based on the plurality system, the percentage of votes cast for a particular candidate is not required. Therefore, I would only need to track the winning candidate name and their vote count. If a client were interested in running an election audit for a local election, the script would need to be modified. Often a local election includes only one county and therefore a county list and county dictionary are not required.
